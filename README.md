# Account-Manager
Simple account manager in Python 3.

Note: By no means is this program "secure". It is just a small program to organize website accounts.

The program uses sqlite3, pathlib, and tabulate.

Account information is saved in a created database named "accounts.db", and the password is saved in a txt file named "pw.txt".
